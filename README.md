🎬 Emmys Nominees App

This is a Python project I built while taking the **"Python: Applying Object-Oriented Programming"** course on [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/).

🎥 What it does

- Add nominees with a title and category
- Mark whether a nominee is available or not ( like a streaming app)
- Register user's reviews with rating from 1 to 10
- Shows average ratings for each nominee
- Prints a full list with status, ratings and categories.
